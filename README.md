To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich)

## My Wage
```
“I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening
When I counted my scanty store.

For Life is a just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.

I worked for a menial’s hire,
Only to learn, dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid.”

-Jessie B. Rittenhouse

### Godfather
```
Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. 
And may their first child be a masculine child. 
I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see.
They talk when they should listen. 
I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please don't do anything. When they come... they come at what you love.

### Ryan Gosling
```
I think like a girl, I think. I wrote you 365 letters. 
Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, 
and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'.
In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth,
and in this movie you're just marinating in it. Change moves in spirals, not circles.
For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down.
My character seems to think that he is, so he would define it.
Anything happens in that five minutes, then I'm yours, no matter what. 
```
### Samuel L Jackson
```
Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me.
Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too.
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. 
You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
