## My Wage
```
“I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening
When I counted my scanty store.

For Life is a just employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.

I worked for a menial’s hire,
Only to learn, dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have willingly paid.”

-Jessie B. Rittenhouse

### Godfather
```
Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. When they come... they come at what you love.
```
